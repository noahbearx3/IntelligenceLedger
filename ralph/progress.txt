## Codebase Patterns
- React + Tailwind CSS for UI components
- Vite for dev server (npm run dev)
- PRD located at PRD.md in project root
- Teams array defined outside App component for reuse
- Controlled inputs with onChange + onKeyDown for Enter handling

- **What was implemented:** News search input in Team/Player DNA section
- **Files changed:** src/App.jsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Added `teams` array at module level for dropdown options
  - Added state: `selectedTeam`, `newsSearchQuery`, `newsSearchActive`
  - Search input placeholder dynamically shows selected team name
  - `handleNewsSearch` function ready for US-003 to add actual filtering
  - Entity dropdown now controlled with value/onChange
